# Is this a PR for an accepted fix?

I welcome Pull Requests for:

- Bug Fixes
- Translation Fixes

Currently not accepting Pull Requests for:

- New Features
- New Translations

If you're eager to help, I genuinely value your intentions. However, since CaretTab is primarily a solo project, I strive to maintain its simplicity for easier management on my part. Consequently, I have limited time to review PRs for new features. Furthermore, each translation introduces extra overhead, which is why I'm currently not considering additional translations.

This is a requested feature / known bug / known issue / good to implement because...

## Have you tested your code?
